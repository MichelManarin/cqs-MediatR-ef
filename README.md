# Instructions

## Installing dependencies

Inside "GrantTest" paste:

### `dotnet build` and `dotnet run`

## I chose MediatR to uncouple the domain, and i used the ef with sqllite to make migrations and manage the database. To make the authentication i chose the default JWT, because its very helpfull.
